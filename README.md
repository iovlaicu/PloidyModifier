# PloidyModifier
## The ASCAT.sc Ploidy Modifier allows the user to manually refit the profiles generated by ASCAT.sc for a more accurate ploidy fitting. 
### The profile of each sample can be visualized and modified
Two types of modifications are possible. You can either change the ploidy of the whole sample (decrease/increase by 1), or modify the copy number of 2 different segments and refit the whole profile based on those. If you are happy with the result, you can save the new profile. Otherwise, you can discard it and start again.
