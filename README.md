# PloidyModifier
## The ASCAT.sc Ploidy Modifier allows the user to manually refit the profiles generated by ASCAT.sc for a more accurate ploidy fitting. 
### The profile of each sample can be visualized and modified
The user must first load the ASCAT.sc rdata object from their computer by providing as input the object name (with its absolute path).
The names of the samples in the data will then be visible. The user can pick one and click on 'view' to visualize its profile.
Two types of modifications are possible. The user can either change the ploidy of the whole sample (decrease/increase by 1), or modify the copy number of 2 different segments and refit the whole profile based on those. If they are happy with the result, they can save the new profile. Otherwise, they can discard it and start again.
